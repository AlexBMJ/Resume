        md: "My name is Alexander Jacobsen, but people usually just call me Alex. I speak Danish, Swedish and English, but prefer digital languages such as Python. I'm generally a very happy person and extremely motivated to deep dive into new topics. \
        \n\nI started programming when I was eight and haven't stopped since, having pressed every button I could reach and played with an abundance of software along the way. I almost always have three or four projects on the side where I can play around with cool new tech. I believe communication is a must when working on a project together with others, meaning social events are a nice welcome. When I’m not in front of a computer, I'm either biking, climbing, singing or playing guitar.",
